      "MICHAEL GISONDI: I can’t say how honored I was to be invited to FIX and included in the Champions of Change Panel. It was intimidating for me to participate, because gender equity is an issue that I am still learning about – and I am no expert. As a child, I was raised in a household in which I regarded my parents as equals. Throughout school, there were always girls (and later women) that outperformed the boys and who kept me on my game. Then when I arrived in residency, I was among 7 men and 1 women in my intern class. It was there, in medicine, that I first witnessed the inequity of women in my chosen profession. In medicine, I watch my female colleagues erroneously referred to as nurses – despite introductions, nametags, and white coats that display otherwise. In medicine, my female colleagues will on average earn less money, receive less promotions, and hold less leadership roles. This is despite spending more time mentoring and coaching trainees, and more time caring for patients.\n"
