      "Historically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as physicians or surgeons for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as allied health professionals has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to medical education. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,[1] and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical specialties and around the world,[2] despite studies suggest that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.[3][4]\n",
